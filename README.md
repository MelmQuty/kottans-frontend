    It was my first  acquaintance with the Git so it was a bit hard for understanding but I did it. Also it's so exciting when you firstly don't understand smth but after hours of practice and efforts you overcame it. The course Version Control with Git has a lot of practice on your own computer, from basics up to some complicated things so it's better to start with this course, because learnbranching course gives you a consolidation of all you knowledge with interactive schemes or maps.
    So now I know how to create a new repository, how to create a new branch, how to switch between them, how to pull, push, merge, rebase and go on.It's awesome!

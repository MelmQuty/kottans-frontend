    It was my first  acquaintance with the Git so it was a bit hard for understanding but I did it. Also it's so exciting when you firstly don't understand smth but after hours of practice and efforts you overcame it. The course Version Control with Git has a lot of practice on your own computer, from basics up to some complicated things so it's better to start with this course, because learnbranching course gives you a consolidation of all you knowledge with interactive schemes or maps.
    So now I know how to create a new repository, how to create a new branch, how to switch between them, how to pull, push, merge, rebase and go on.It's awesome!
    
    ### <a name="linux_networking">Linux CLI and Networking</a>
    
    ![Linux_Survival](task_linux_cli/linux_gif.gif)
    
    **Linux Survival** - is definitely improved my skills in command line, I learned a lof of new commands such as ls, cs, mkdir, kill, ps, aux, df, lpr, mv, ca and go on.But for sure I need to practice more.
    
    **HTTP/HTTPs** - there was a lot of a new information for me but it was a really interesting article. I figured out about the https and ssl sertificates, verbs and status codes and I know that it will help me in the future when I will work with frameworks or some libraries. By some time I will reread this article to remember more.
    
    ### <a name="git_collaboration">Git Collaboration</a>
    
    ![Git_collaboration](task_git_collaboration/git_collaboration1.png)
    
    This Udacity is a really awesome platform for learning Git.However I learned how to push,pull(fetch and merge),make pull requests earlier but there is an essential information about working in team and how to collaborate with others developers.
